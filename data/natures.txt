0|Empty|-|-|This nature does not exist.
1|Hardy|0:5|8:2|This pokemon is just your standard healthy pokemon, it spends most of its days gathering food and is perfectly content to remain a wild pokemon. Personality wise, nothing about this pokemon really stands out.
2|Lonely|1:5,2:-5,7:2|18:-2|This pokemon is an outcast, they don’t have many friends and for this reason they may be more eager to make friends and easier to persuade to join your party.
3|Brave|1:5,5:-5|16:2,17:2|This pokemon is not scared easily, and they don’t back down from a dangerous situation. This pokemon is the kind of pokemon which would run into a burning building to save it’s trainer or face down a legendary pokemon fearlessly.
4|Adamant|1:5,3:-5,7:-2|18:2|Convincing this pokemon to do something it doesn’t want to do could is like arguing with a brick wall. This pokemon is not very likely to listen to a new trainer and it will take a considerable amount of effort to get this pokemon to obey the actions of its trainer out of trust vs. self-interest.
5|Naughty|1:5,4:-5|18:2|Like the adamant personality, this pokemon is very ill behaved. From jumping on the table and eating off its trainer’s plate, to urinating on the carpet. This pokemon’s unruly behavior is a choice rather than a simple misunderstanding. However, while it may be frustrating to deal with at first, with a little love and some well managed discipline even this pokemon can shine.
6|Bold|2:5,1:-5,7:2|12:2|This pokemon is extremely outgoing and loves to show off to both other pokemon and people alike. This type of pokemon normally forms a bond with its own trainer extremely quick and often ends up dragging them into its show
7|Docile|7:2|-|This pokemon is easy to handle and would make a good companion for a beginning pokemon trainer. This pokemon is much less likely to attack (unless provoked) and while it may still disobey its trainer’s orders, it probably won’t choose to attack its trainer due to a disagreement either.
8|Relaxed|2:5,5:-5,7:2|-|Like the docile pokemon type, this pokemon is easier to handle due to its low stress nature. This pokemon is much less likely to become nervous in an unfamiliar environment and will be able to remain calm even in rough situations.
9|Impish|2:5,3:-5|11:2|This pokemon loves playing jokes on people and pokemon alike. From scribbling on sleeping pokemon’s faces to purposely walking underfoot to trip people. This pokemon loves to joke around and this sometimes can get them or their trainer into trouble when one of their jokes is carried too far.
10|Lax|2:5,4:-5|18:4,17:4|This pokemon is a bit of a slacker. This pokemon can be challenging to motivate for an unexperienced trainer as it will often be caught loafing when given orders. Even food items may not work to persuade it
11|Timid|5:5,1:-5|16:-2,11:2,17:2,18:-2|This pokemon can be jumpy and scares easily. Using intimidation on them may seem like a clever idea but most likely it will make them shut down versus whatever the desired effect is. A gentle hand is required with raising this pokemon as well as an understanding that there will be situations in which this pokemon simply cannot perform no matter what the cost.
12|Hasty|5:5,2:-5|11:2|This pokemon can be described as impatient, and it often rushes into things. This can be especially detrimental in cases where a battle is dragging on longer than expected. The trainer can also have problems with this pokemon in situations such as fishing or waiting for a wild pokemon to wander into a trap and it would be best to keep a pokemon of this personality type inside it’s poke ball during these situations.
13|Serious|-|14:2|This pokemon is the opposite of the Naughty personality and is usually very well behaved. However, problems can arise because of this as well. This pokemon will expect its trainer to follow suit with its own personality and if paired up with a more relaxed or emotional trainer this pokemon could refuse to follow orders out of frustration.
14|Jolly|5:5,3:-5, 7:2|17:-2,18:2|This pokemon is generally easy going and happy. It is usually easy to make friends with this pokemon and intimidation works well as it normally catches the pokemon off guard; however, this approach shouldn’t be used too frequently as it can damage the bond between trainer and pokemon.
15|Naive|5:5,3:-5, 7:4|18:-4,17:-4|Like the matching trainer type, this pokemon is extremely trusting of other pokemon and humans. While this may make it easier to induct as a party member; it can also cause some serious grief for its trainer as well.
16|Modest|3:5,1:-5|18:2,17:-2|This pokemon has some self-esteem issues and doesn’t see the full potential they hold. While this generally makes them less likely to rush into dangerous situations, it can also prevent them from fighting or from performing to their fullest as they may not have sufficient self-confidence in their own abilities.
17|Mild|3:5,2:-5|18:-2,17:-4|This pokemon is slow to anger and will usually put up with a lot before acting out. This is another good nature type for beginners as mild pokemon can usually be persuaded or intimidated easily. However, like with the timid pokemon; frequent intimidation could be disastrous in the event the pokemon’s patience finally runs out.
18|Quiet|3:5,5:-5|10:2|This pokemon can be quite shy and introverted. This pokemon could be extremely challenging to try to persuade to join your party as they just want to be left alone. However, if paired up with the right trainer, this pokemon could be a fantastic companion as well, just make sure to give them their space when needed.
19|Bashful|-|12:-2|This pokemon is easily embarrassed which could make it easier to catch and could spell disaster during a match if something happens which make it feel like all eyes are on it. Additionally, this would not be a suitable candidate for an entertainer or beauty contest as this pokemon would almost be certain to suffer from stage fright.
20|Rash|3:5,4:-5|14:-2|This pokemon tends to rush into things without thinking and tends to have a “live in the moment” attitude. Usually this pokemon could also be described as having attention problems and will normally act on whatever happens to be running through its head at any given moment.
21|Calm|4:5,1:-5|17:2,18:2,16:4|This pokemon is so calm it can seem almost emotionless at times. It is extremely hard to intimidate or persuade this pokemon to join the trainer’s party. During battle this pokemon will have no trouble keeping calm in disadvantageous situations or listening to its trainer’s orders.
22|Gentle|4:5,2:-5|11:2,14:2|This pokemon has a solid understanding of its own power and understands exactly how much of that power is required in different situations. Additionally, this pokemon is also extremely good at reading the emotions of other pokemon and people. Even if this pokemon looks big and scary on the outside this pokemon will always make sure to take that into consideration when dealing with its trainer or another pokemon.
23|Sassy|4:5,5:-5,7:-5|18:2,17:2|This pokemon is aloof and can even seem cold depending on the trainer raising it. This pokemon considers its friendship to be a luxury and it will take a heavy amount of doting on it before it will even consider obeying its trainer’s orders. Additionally, it’s trainer’s social standing will also impact things and this pokemon will never obey the orders of someone it considers to be “low class”.
24|Careful|4:5,3:-5|14:2,15:2,11:2,17:2,14:2,10:2|This pokemon is extremely cautious and will never take risks either in battle or in dealing with other pokemon or people. When facing a pokemon of this nature, they may bait their opponent to figure out their true strength before fighting seriously. They are also extremely good at avoiding traps, sneaking, and often are very guarded in regard to their surroundings. This pokemon will take a lot of work in order to recruit outside of battle. They also can be extremely hard to raise as they may disobey their trainer’s orders if they feel that they’re taking unnecessary risks. However, in the hands of the right trainer this pokemon is extremely strong.
25|Quirky|-|-|This pokemon is odd to say the least. They may have weird habits or strange foods they like to eat. At times it may seem like this pokemon is one egg short of a dozen, but at other times they can be extremely lucid and clear. Every day with this pokemon is a surprise and it can make training it difficult at times. However just like any other pokemon, they can also be a great partner if the trainer is willing to overlook the quirks.
